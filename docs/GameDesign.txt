--Concept
It's a networked, donkey-kong style platformer where 
two teams of developers battle to see who can
drink the most coffee. (The coffee is at the top of the level.)

--Target platforms 
*Web / mobile

--UI / Player controls
*SPACE for jumping
*ARROWS for left/right

--Game mechanics
*Players jump over programs that bother them, like ManicTime, Visio, etc.
*Players can jump on a FREEZE box that will freeze other players'
Visual Studio editors. 
*Players that get to the top and touch the coffee beaker will increase 
their team's caffeination.

--Assets
*Sprite for each member of the team
*Coffee sprite
*Freeze box sprite and press sound
*Game music!
